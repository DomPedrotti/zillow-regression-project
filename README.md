# Zillow Home Value Estimator
Hello, Welcome to my first Regression project! 
I'll be using sklearn regression models to predict home values from Zillow data

### Libraries used:
- Pandas
- Numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- sklearn
- statsmodels
- scipy

### Dependancies:
You'll need the libraries listed as well as a username and password to our data science database (which can only be obtained by a Codeup Data Science student)

### Process

I. **Acquiring the data:**
- Used SQL query to pull data from class database
- Data set was large (~29 mil entries) so for the scope of the project, I limited my query to select only single family properties sold from May-June of 2017 (~22,000)

II. **Cleaning**
